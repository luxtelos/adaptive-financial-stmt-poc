## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Context

The QuickBooks Analyzer application requires a modern, responsive web interface that can handle complex financial data visualization, real-time updates, and integration with multiple external services (QuickBooks API, Perplexity AI, Supabase). The frontend needs to:

- Provide a professional, intuitive interface for CPAs and financial professionals
- Handle complex state management for financial data and user sessions
- Support real-time data synchronization with QuickBooks
- Generate and display dynamic financial reports and visualizations
- Maintain high performance even with large datasets
- Enable rapid feature development and iteration
- Ensure code maintainability and team scalability

The development team has expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and values type safety to prevent runtime errors in critical financial calculations.

## Decision

We will use React 18 with TypeScript as our frontend framework, bundled with Vite for development and build optimization.

### Specific Technology Choices:
- **React 18.3.1**: Latest stable version with Concurrent Features
- **TypeScript 5.5.3**: Strong typing for financial data structures
- **Vite 5.4.2**: Fast build tool with excellent DX and HMR
- **React Router 7.1.1**: Client-side routing for SPA navigation
- **React Hook Form 7.62.0**: Performant form handling with validation
- **Zod 4.0.17**: Runtime type validation for API responses

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Angular with TypeScript
**Pros:**
- Comprehensive framework with everything built-in
- Strong enterprise adoption in financial sector
- Excellent TypeScript support from the ground up
- Built-in dependency injection

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve for team members
- More opinionated structure might slow initial development
- Larger bundle size for initial load
- Less flexibility for custom architectural patterns

### 2. Vue.js 3 with TypeScript
**Pros:**
- Gentle learning curve
- Excellent documentation
- Good TypeScript support in Vue 3
- Smaller bundle size than React

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem for financial/enterprise components
- Less mature TypeScript integration compared to React
- Fewer developers in the talent pool
- Limited enterprise adoption in financial sector

### 3. Next.js (React Framework)
**Pros:**
- Built-in SSR/SSG capabilities
- Excellent SEO out of the box
- API routes for backend functionality
- Image optimization and performance features

**Cons:**
- Overhead for features we don't need (SSR not required for CPA dashboard)
- More complex deployment requirements
- Vendor lock-in to Vercel for optimal performance
- Conflicts with our Netlify deployment strategy

### 4. Plain JavaScript with React
**Pros:**
- No TypeScript compilation overhead
- Simpler setup and configuration
- Faster initial development

**Cons:**
- No type safety for financial calculations
- Higher risk of runtime errors
- Difficult to refactor as codebase grows
- Poor IDE support for autocomplete and error detection

## Rationale

React with TypeScript provides the optimal balance of:

1. **Type Safety**: Critical for financial data accuracy and preventing costly calculation errors
2. **Ecosystem**: Vast library ecosystem with specialized financial/charting components
3. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, hot reload, and debugging capabilities
4. **Performance**: Virtual DOM and React 18's concurrent features handle large datasets efficiently
5. **Community Support**: Large community ensures long-term viability and problem-solving resources
6. **Talent Availability**: Easy to find experienced React developers
7. **Component Reusability**: Component-based architecture aligns with our UI requirements

The combination with Vite provides:
- Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Optimized production builds with code splitting
- Native ES modules in development
- Built-in TypeScript support

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors at compile time, reducing financial calculation bugs
2. **Developer Productivity**: IntelliSense, auto-completion, and refactoring tools increase development speed
3. **Code Maintainability**: Self-documenting code through types and interfaces
4. **Component Ecosystem**: Access to libraries like Recharts for financial visualizations
5. **Team Scalability**: Easier onboarding with typed contracts between components
6. **Performance**: React 18's automatic batching and suspense improve user experience
7. **Testing**: Excellent testing ecosystem with React Testing Library and Jest

### Negative Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**: Team members need proficiency in both React and TypeScript
2. **Build Complexity**: TypeScript compilation adds build time (mitigated by Vite)
3. **Bundle Size**: React runtime adds ~45KB gzipped to bundle
4. **State Management**: Need additional solution for complex state (addressed in ADR-0005)
5. **SEO Limitations**: Client-side rendering not optimal for SEO (acceptable for dashboard app)

## Implementation Considerations

### Setup Requirements
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "typescript": "^5.5.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.3.5",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.1",
    "vite": "^5.4.2"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
- Path aliases for clean imports
- Separate configs for app and Node environments

### Code Organization
```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── services/       # Business logic and API calls
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
├── lib/           # Utility functions
└── config/        # Configuration files
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting with React.lazy() for large components
- Memoization with React.memo for expensive renders
- Virtual scrolling for large financial data tables
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-0002**: Supabase integration requires React Query or similar for data fetching
- **ADR-0003**: Clerk authentication integrates seamlessly with React
- **ADR-0005**: Component architecture leverages React's composition model
- **ADR-0007**: Netlify deployment optimized for React SPAs
- **ADR-0010**: Client-side PDF generation works well with React's state management
