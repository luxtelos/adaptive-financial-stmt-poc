# ADR-0003: Implement Clerk for User Authentication and Management

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-22

## Context

The QuickBooks Analyzer application requires a robust authentication system that can:

- Provide secure authentication for CPA professionals handling sensitive financial data
- Support multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth providers)
- Integrate seamlessly with our React frontend and Supabase backend
- Handle user session management across multiple devices
- Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
- Provide user profile management and organization features
- Scale to thousands of concurrent users
- Comply with financial industry security standards
- Enable rapid implementation without building auth from scratch

Critical requirements include:
- **Security**: SOC 2 compliant, encrypted sessions, secure token handling
- **User Experience**: Seamless sign-up/sign-in flow, passwordless options
- **Integration**: Compatible with Supabase RLS through JWTs
- **Compliance**: GDPR ready, audit logs for financial compliance
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for organizational accounts and user roles
- **Developer Experience**: Quick integration, minimal maintenance overhead

## Decision

We will use Clerk as our authentication and user management provider, implementing:

- **Hosted Authentication UI**: Clerk's pre-built, customizable components
- **JWT Integration**: Custom claims for Supabase RLS policies
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: TOTP, SMS, and backup codes
- **OAuth Providers**: Google, Microsoft (important for enterprise CPAs)
- **Organization Management**: Multi-tenant support for CPA firms
- **Session Management**: Secure, cross-device session handling

### Implementation Details:
```javascript
// Clerk version and configuration
"@clerk/clerk-react": "^5.20.0"

// JWT template for Supabase integration
{
  "clerk_id": "{{user.id}}",
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "organization_id": "{{user.organization_id}}"
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Auth0
**Pros:**

   - Edge runtime compatible

5. **Organization Features**:
   - Built-in support for CPA firms with multiple users
   - Role-based access control
   - Invitation system for team members
   - Centralized billing for organizations

6. **Cost Efficiency**:

   - Predictable pricing ($25 for 5,000 MAU)
   - No surprise costs or feature gates
   - Includes all security features

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Rapid Implementation**: Authentication complete in days, not months
2. **Enterprise Security**: MFA, SSO-ready, audit logs included
3. **Improved UX**: Professional auth flow increases user trust
4. **Reduced Maintenance**: Clerk handles security patches and updates
5. **Scalability**: Handles authentication load as user base grows
6. **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, GDPR compliant out of the box
7. **Organization Support**: Natural multi-tenancy for CPA firms
8. **Developer Productivity**: More time for core features

### Negative Consequences

1. **Service Dependency**: Application relies on Clerk's availability
2. **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration would require reimplementing auth
3. **Cost Scaling**: Recurring monthly costs increase with users
4. **Customization Limits**: Some advanced flows require workarounds
5. **Data Residency**: User data stored in Clerk's infrastructure
6. **Integration Complexity**: JWT template must be maintained for Supabase

## Implementation Considerations

### Integration with React
```typescript
// App.tsx setup
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <AuthWrapper>
        <AuthenticatedApp />
      </AuthWrapper>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

### Supabase RLS Integration
```typescript
// Custom JWT template in Clerk Dashboard
{
  "iss": "https://clerk.your-app.com",
  "sub": "{{user.id}}",
  "clerk_id": "{{user.id}}",
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "org_id": "{{user.organization_id}}",
  "org_role": "{{user.organization_role}}",
  "iat": "{{current_timestamp}}",
  "exp": "{{current_timestamp + 3600}}"
}
```

### User Synchronization
```typescript
// Webhook handler for user events
export async function handleClerkWebhook(event: WebhookEvent) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'user.created':
      await supabase.from('users').insert({
        clerk_id: event.data.id,
        email: event.data.email_addresses[0].email_address,
        created_at: new Date()
      });
      break;
    case 'organization.created':
      await syncOrganization(event.data);
      break;
  }
}
```

### Security Configuration
- Enable MFA for all users handling financial data
- Implement session timeout for inactive users
- Configure allowed redirect URLs
- Set up webhook signing secrets
- Enable bot protection
- Configure password policies

### Organization Setup for CPA Firms
```typescript
// Organization-based access control
const { organization } = useOrganization();

// Check organization membership
if (!organization) {
  return <CreateOrJoinOrganization />;
}

// Role-based permissions
const canAccessReports = organization.role === 'admin' || 
                        organization.role === 'member';
```

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-0001**: React components use Clerk's hooks for auth state
- **ADR-0002**: Supabase RLS policies use Clerk JWT claims
- **ADR-0006**: QuickBooks OAuth flow initiated after Clerk auth
- **ADR-0009**: Multi-tenancy leverages Clerk organizations

## Migration Strategy

If migration from Clerk becomes necessary:
1. Export user data via Clerk API
2. Implement replacement auth system
3. Migrate user sessions gracefully
4. Update JWT claims in Supabase policies
5. Notify users of auth system change
6. Provide password reset for all users

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: JWTs signed with RS256
- **Session Management**: 7-day sliding sessions
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements
- **MFA Enforcement**: Required for admin roles
- **Audit Logging**: All auth events logged
- **Rate Limiting**: 20 attempts per IP per hour

## Cost Analysis

Pricing tiers and expected costs:
- **Free**: Up to 5,000 monthly active users
- **Pro ($25/month)**: 5,000-10,000 MAU
- **Business ($99/month)**: 10,000-20,000 MAU
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing above 20,000 MAU

Additional features included in all tiers:
- Unlimited organizations
- All authentication methods
- MFA support
- Audit logs
- Custom domains (Pro+)

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance:
- Authentication latency: < 200ms
- Token validation: < 10ms (cached)
- Session lookup: < 50ms
- MFA verification: < 1s
- Uptime SLA: 99.99%
